This past summer I had the priveledge of working in a Computational Biology lab under Dr. Rams and the task was to be able to take in a pdb and mrc file and ouput a new pdb file that would have the local resolution map that would be able to be represented in Pymol/Chimerax.

Here is the link to the google Colabs notebook that we made!
